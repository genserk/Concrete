# Eco-Concrete

The Erdos Institute Spring 2023 Bootcamp Project

### Projectgit 

The problem we wish to address is the carbon footprint of concrete. The main source of carbon is the cement so our goal is to find a low cement mixture that still meets certain strength thresholds.

Our stakeholders include any entity interested in using or making environmentally friendly concrete:
- Concrete manufacturers
- Concrete ingredient suppliers
- Construction companies
- Construction clients, private or public
- Environmental agencies
- US Department of Labor
- Materials scientists


Our key performance indicators are:
- the accuracy of the model, using root mean squared error
- its efficacy at recommending mixtures based on clients' varying priorities

### Dataset
From Kaggle, Civil Engineering: Cement Manufacturing Dataset
"The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. Data is in raw form (not scaled). The data has 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable, and 1030 instances (observations)."



### How does it work ?
-Step1: Clone the repository and install requirements as listed in the requirements.txt file.

-Step2: Download datasets from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinayakshanawad/cement-manufacturing-concrete-dataset, and add it to data folder
